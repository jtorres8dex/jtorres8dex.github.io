    <h2>RLLib and its Implications</h2>
    <p>
      Spending a good amount of time developing AI agents to perform in
      simulated systems, I have had the realization that this framework also
      describes a useful model of life [1]. Viewing things as if we are agents
      playing a game trying to maximize some reward has great utility in my
      opinion. We have desires (some state we are trying to get to) and must
      learn the rules of the game (understand both the situation we are in) and
      act in ways that will get us what we want(reason how we can manipulate
      inputs to it to get a desired output)
    </p>

    <h2>Observation Space</h2>
    <p>
      I think self awareness is an incredibly valuable thing to have. It is
      paramount to self growth.

    <h2>Action Space</h2>
    <h2>Iterative Improvements</h2>
    <h2>Reward Functions</h2>

    <h2>Skill Issues</h2>

    <p>
      There are few things you cannot improve by actively trying to in a clever
      way. So many of your insecurities are a skill issue. You can educate
      yourself, improve physical appearance, become more sociable, strengthen
      your professional & social network, mature emotionally, .
    </p>

    <p>
      Genetics and circumstance of birth of course play a huge roll in these
      things. You don't get to choose where you fall on the bell curve of any
      given characteristic. But consistent, calculated actions for a long enough
      time, without pompously convincing yourself you're more talented than you
      are or pesimistically convincing yourself you're dumber than you are, can
      always monotonically improve your situation.

    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>
      [1] No reference, just acknowledging that there's no way I'm the first
      person to think of things this way. In fact Silicon Valley Twitter likely
      has some seed stage founder rambling about the same thing everyday. Also
      now that I think of it you probably cover this in an introductory level
      Game Theory course. But its my website so I get to act like this is a
      novel idea.
