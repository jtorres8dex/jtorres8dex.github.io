    <h2>RLLib and its Implications</h2>
    <p>
      Spending a good amount of time developing AI agents to perform in
      simulated systems, I have had the realization that this framework also
      describes a useful model of life [1]. Viewing things as if we are agents
      playing a game trying to maximize some reward has great utility in my
      opinion. We have desires (some state we are trying to get to) and must
      learn the rules of the game (understand both the situation we are in) and
      act in ways that will get us what we want(reason how we can manipulate
      inputs to it to get a desired output)
    </p>

    <h2>Observation Space</h2>
    <p>
      I think self awareness is an incredibly valuable thing to have. It is
      paramount to self growth.

    <h2>Action Space</h2>
    <h2>Iterative Improvements</h2>
    <h2>Reward Functions</h2>

    <h2>Skill Issues</h2>

    <p>
      There are few things you cannot improve by actively trying to in a clever
      way. So many of your insecurities are a skill issue. You can educate
      yourself, improve physical appearance, become more sociable, strengthen
      your professional & social network, mature emotionally, .
    </p>

      Genetics and circumstance of birth of course play a huge roll in these
      things. You don't get to choose where you fall on the bell curve of any
      given characteristic, at least for your initial conditions. But
      consistent, calculated actions for a long enough time, without pompously
      convincing yourself you're more talented than you are or pesimistically
      convincing yourself you're dumber than you are, can always monotonically
      improve your situation.

    <h2>The Games We Play</h2>
    <p>
      Given that everyone has their own internal model of the world, everyone is
      going to have different incentives. Different incentives means playing
      different games. In other words, everyone is trying to get something
      different out of life. The most obvious game people play is trying to work
      their way up in their career. But alot of people are simply trying to
      maximize sources of pleasure in their life. Their job is just something
      they do to be able to live. An easy example of this population can be
      found among people around my age - in their early 20's. They prioritize
      traveling, dating, and living an aesthetical lifestyle. I believe these
      principles still apply. You can iteratively improve at all these things.
      And I dont judge, these games are just as arbitrary as the ones I choose
      to play.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its not a novel idea that different people play different games. I think
      the more interesting question is why people choose the games they play.
      Why do some people obsess over professional status whereas others are
      motivated by maximizing a source of pleasure? An easy starting point is to
      consider two different people. One is a conventionally attractive woman
      with an IQ of 100 and the other is a conventionally unattractive male with
      an IQ of 130. From an early age, these two people will be handed hugely
      different reward functions. Its easy to predict the path that each are
      likely to follow. We tend to repeatedly push our chips, and take an
      interest along the way, into things we have a natural affinity towards.

    <h3>References</h3>

      [1] No reference, just acknowledging that there's no way I'm the first
      person to think of things this way. In fact Silicon Valley Twitter likely
      has some seed stage founder rambling about the same thing everyday. Also
      now that I think of it you probably cover this in an introductory level
      Game Theory course. But its my website so I get to act like this is a
      novel idea.
