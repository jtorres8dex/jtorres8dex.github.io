      At its core, Autonomous Systems boil down to a very finite set of concepts that if mastered, allow one to truly build
      something fucking magical.

      <li>Data Strutures</li>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
      <li>Computer Architecture</li>
      <li>Operating Systems</li>
      <li>Computer Networks</li>
      <li>Modeling of Dynamic Systems</li>
      <li>Control Theory (Specifically Linear & Optimal)</li>

      <li>Game Theory</li>
      <li>Computational Methods</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These topics, from what I have gathered in my admittingly small amount of time of being in this field, form the basis of
      >99% of Autonomy Systems. On the software side most any tool, library, or service you come across are merely an abstractions
      of one of the above topics that relieve a developer of some responsibility, headache, or redundancy. Docker, ZMQ, Redis,
      VMs, Numpy, AWS you name it. It does exactly this. On the theory side, knowing these concepts in both breadth and depth give
      you the literacy to implement any algorithm,
