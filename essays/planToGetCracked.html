    <h1>The Plan to Get Cracked</h1>

    <!-- <p>
      "I know this kid who is so cracked he could rewrite this whole
      module in a night, he just took a job at a FAANG 160 TC - "
    </p> -->

      Cracked (Adj.) - describes someone who is extremely good at something,
      colloqially used in excess among Programmers & Engineers. Example: My
      friend is so cracked at programming he could write 10x the code of the
      average person.

      The thing about "rising up" in an engineering career is the job
      continuously gets harder. The higher you rise (this to be defined shortly)
      the smarter the people around you will be. The faster and more efficient
      you will be expected to solve problems.

      I've been working full time on intelligent systems for a little over a
      year now. I'd like to think I've got enough experience under my belt to
      form an actual opinion on something. Maybe one day I will come across this
      and think how dumb I was. Oh well.

      At its core, Autonomous Systems boil down to a very finite set of concepts
      that if mastered, allow one to build truly magical stuff.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Data Strutures</li>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
      <li>Computer Architecture</li>
      <li>Operating Systems</li>
      <li>Computer Networks</li>
      <li>Modeling of Dynamic Systems</li>
      <li>Control Theory (Specifically Linear & Optimal)</li>
      <li>Linear Algebra</li>
      <li>Optimization Theory</li>
      <li>Game Theory</li>
      <li>Computational Methods</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From what I have gathered in my admittingly small amount of time of being
      in this field, these topics form the basis of >99% of Autonomy Systems. On
      the software side most any tool, library, or service you come across are
      merely an abstractions of one of the above topics that relieve a developer
      of some responsibility, headache, or redundancy. Docker, ZMQ, Redis, VMs,
      Numpy, AWS you name it. It does exactly this. On the theory side, knowing
      these concepts in both breadth and depth give you an incredibly strong
      handle on developing intelligent systems as well as a solid base of
      literacy to read academic papers to learn and implement ideas as needed.

      Of course actually learning these subjects is no easy feat. It is neither
      necessary nor sufficient to get an A in some undergraduate class. Learning
      something is much more than that. To understand something is to spend a
      ton of hours utterly confused trying to understand 3 lines of math. It is
      banging your head against the wall for days at a time wondering why some
      implementation of some algorithm isn't working. It is not only adding a
      tool to your tool kit, it is developing the intuition on when and why a
      given tool is the ideal one for the problem at hand. It takes a lifetime.
      There is no such thing as a master.

      As said I'm a little over a year into my career, and my thoughts & beliefs
      on these things are no doubt subject to change given I'm still in the
      transient phase.
