    <h1>Essays I've Written</h1>

    <p>
      I have always really enjoyed writing. I wrote some bangers back in the day
      in AP English. Didn't get really into STEM even until undergrad. These
      days, doing math and programming so many hours a week gives me an urge to
      use the other part of my brain. And I find it to be a useful exercise for
      a variety of reasons. Its good practice for expressing abstract ideas and
      helps filter our perceptions of the world. No doubt there exists >>1
      stupid opinion, illogical argument, or reductive conclusion in these. I am
      no genius. Oh well. Wisdom is achieved only through iteration.
