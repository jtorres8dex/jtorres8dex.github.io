      I want to one day start a company. I've had various experiences that led
      me to this conclusion but just assume I know with absolute certainty that
      this is what I want to do. Given this vague desire
    </p>

    <p>
      NOTE: I have zero formal education in business or economics. I am very
      likely getting going to say something that is debatable at the very least.
      This is moreso an explanation on what my mental model currently is.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coming out of undergrad I wholeheartedly believed that the best way to
      build a foundation to build a company was to work for a startup. I still
      believe this to be a very valid argument and true in many cases. However,
      my technical experience (and really the things I enjoy working on the
      most) are primarily Robotics & Aerospace. Starting a company in these
      industries is a whole other beast. You're not making some SAAS product
      and marketing your way into a positive cash flow. You have to build
      something that is incredibly difficult and expensive. There are almost no
      flukes in Deep Tech. I am confident that I am intelligent enough to work at
      one of these startups, but founding one is likely not the best strategy
      for me. Put simply, I have the intellectual self awareness that Deep Tech
      is not my best bet given my skill set.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows then, that my best bet at starting a company is one that is not
      as technical as an AI robotics company but still leveraging some skill I
      have. Still, these definitions are to vague.
