    <h1>On Ambition</h1>

    <h2>Ambition To Me</h2>
    <p>
      Defined as "a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically
      requiring determination and hard work", this concept has been one of
      contention to me throughout the last couple years. This idea of forsaking
      satisfactions in hopes of a greater payoff down the line has been
      something I either emit with pride or reject with disgust. Depending on
      what day of the week you ask me. To have tasteless yet nutritious foods as
      investment in a better physical aesthetic. To do work instead of some
      mindless form of entertainment as invesetment in learning or solving
      something over time. We make choices everyday that compound over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ambition was instilled in me at an early age by my parents. They placed it
      above almost everything else. Coming from quite humble backgrounds,
      ambition was their ticket to better times. It undoubtedly brought them to
      better circumstances in life. They observed themselves in some state A
      (experiencing poverty, sickness, tragedy), and they desired to be in state
      B (experiencing financial stability, health, and a happy family). They
      spent years of their life, climbing from the gutter, to get from state A
      to state B and achieve these exact things. Witnessing this mobility
      firsthand certainly had a strong influence on my brothers and I. My
      parents led by example. I am of course thankful for my parents instilling
      this in me especially as I get older. Another part of growing up however,
      is taking an audit of how your parents did. Comparing your increasingly
      developed principles to those your parents raised you with. I imagine this
      is only natural for those with a sense of agency and intellectual
      independence (so much for not being egotisical in these essays-im so smart
      have such high agency blah blah blah).
    </p>

    <h2>The Cost of Ambition</h2>
    <p>
      It makes sense the prevailing sentimate on ambition is entirely positive.
      Across almost all societal domains and cultures, ambition said to be
      paramount. But as most things that are said to be able to do no wrong, I
      can't help but ask if there needs to be a bound of the dosage we feed
      ourselves. There surely exists a point in which an individual is to
      consumed by their ambitions and it beings acting adversely towards
      reaching their goals. In fact this theme is present in popular literary
      and film works, often embedded into characters - Julius Caesar,
      Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov, Tony Montana, and Walter White to name a few. I
      ruminate so much on this because I have lately been realizing that
      ambition tends to be a convenient default setting. There's such a simple
      and viable justification for why one's current suffering is justified and
      will ultimately yield better conditions. I consider myself guilty of this.
      I dont say this as a pat on the back or to talk about how disiplined and
      great I am. Rather, I pose the question of exactly what trade offs one
      makes when having their ambitions so high in their priority queue.

      In structuring one's life to be a series of hurdles to get over, yes of
      course they will make progress towards any concrete goal they set, but
      what do they miss out on? Junk food tastes good, getting drunk with your
      friends is fun, and conventional wisdom says to be happy with what you
      have. On the latter, is this saying not a direct counterargument to
      ambition? Take for example those who ascribe the meaning of life to be
      rooted in Hedonism. Those who view their career merely as means of
      financial support. They have no passion for their job and the second they
      clock out they are getting drinks with their friends watching their
      favorite sports team without a care in the world. Or an example more
      appropiate to my age, those who are currently working their first random
      job they took largely to live in a desired city, taking advantage their
      freedom and lack of responsibility of one's 20's. They aren't putting
      themselves in a particularly good position to be successful in their
      career, but they are having the time of their life. Deploying greedy
      algorithm so to speak. How can you not at least consider this to be the
      better strategy?
    </p>

    <p>
      Every unit of resources allocated to one's career, fitness, or whatever
      glory we promise ourselves on the other side of present discomfort, is a
      unit subtracted from other aspects of the human experience. There is an
      inherent trade off that comes with investing yourself into something. If
      the goal is to maximize (over a lifetime)
      happiness/fulfillment/bliss/peace or whatever you want to call it, how can
      we be surpised if ambition is not what one's desires tend towards. We are
      all just agents in a game trying to maximize some utility function. A very
      non-trivial percent of agents pursue this greedy algorithm. There is no
      doubt some merit to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I acknowledge my bias in this conversation, I am living on the other side
      of the spectrum. Working full time and getting a masters consumes the
      majority of this chapter of my life. Ambition is, at least for the moment,
      necessarily the fuel in which I get through all my to-do's.
    </p>

    <h2>Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze</h2>
    <p>
      A final disclaimer here: I have no idea yet if the cost ambition is worth
      what it costs. I do not intend to argue for one way or the other. My plans
      are yet to bear fruit, but that is expected given the time horizon I'm
      optimizing over. I have a whole lifetime to go. That is why this question
      weights so heavily on me. I hold the belief that these daily habits fueled
      by ambition compound over time and that life should eventually converge to
      what I want it to be. At the same time however, I certainly acknowledge
      the opportunity cost this has.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question then becomes, like most other philosophical questions on
      human nature (dude im such a philospher), one of nuance. Given an
      individual with their unique values, preferences, and incentives, what is
      the optimal dose of ambition they should have? How do you best get what
      you want out of life without working to hard at it and missing out on the
      things you will retrospectively care about?
