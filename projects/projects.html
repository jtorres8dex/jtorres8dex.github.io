        I started this project when I realized being comfortable in C++ is basically a non-negotiable to write Flight Software Systems.
        It's basically a low fidelity 3DOF simulation library for differential drive robots. Not the most impressive thing to be honest. It's 
        purpose however is for me to have my own playground where I can learn and implement concepts I want to gain a better understanding of.
        As of 8/18/24 I a have finished an MVP of a multi-agent environment with an interface to test various agents. Soon to get started on 
        an MVP of a basic graphy theory algorithm for the canonical Rendevous Problem. Once I get to this point that I have arbitrarily 
        ascribed to be the level at which I can justify putting on my resume, I want to focus on high performance computing. From thread level
        paralellism to multi-processing to maybe even Cudafying. Behind work and graduate school, this is very low on my priority queue and progress
        is sporadic.
